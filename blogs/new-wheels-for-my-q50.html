          I recently bought some new wheels which I am excited to put on! They
          are Work VSKF's which were my dream wheels and I am happy to finally
          own some. However, I did buy them despite them having a flaw, one of
          the wheel's inner barrel was cracked. The good thing about these
          wheels is that they are three pieces so I only need to buy the
          replacement piece and not an entire wheel; inner barrel, outer barrel,
          center(face). I plan on chroming them out too, since that is my
          preferred finish on wheels!
